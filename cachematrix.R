# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.
# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to set the value of the matrix, ,to get the value of the matrix
# to set the value of inverse of the matrix and to get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.
# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
          message("getting cached data")
          return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
